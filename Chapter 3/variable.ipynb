    "# Variable Declaration: Memory Handling at the Core\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how python manages memory at the variable level is crucial for writing eficient and optimized code. Unlike languages like C or C++, Python __does not store variables directly in memory.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, variable act as __references(labels) to objects__ stored in the __heap memory__.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Syntex & Structured \n",
    "```\n",

    "variable_name = value\n",

    "```\n",
    "- __Variables in Python act as references__ to objects stored in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `=` __assignment operator__ does __not store value directly__ in the variable, but rather than __binds the variable name to an object in memory__.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The __CPython Interpreter__ manages memory using a __private heap__.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Syntax Rules for Variable Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Python useses the assignment operator (`=`):__\n",
    "    - The left-hand side (`variable_name`) is the __label (reference).__\n",
    "    - The right-hand side (`value`) is the __object stored in memory.__\n",
    "    - __Example:__\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    x = 10 # x is a reference to the object 10\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. __Python does not required explicit type declaration:__\n",
    "    - Python __dynamically assigns__ type based on the assigned value. \n",
    "    - __Example:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    a = \"Hello\"     # a is a reference to a string object\n",
    "    b = 3.14        # b is a reference to a float object\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Multiple assignments are possible:__\n",
    "    - __Example:__\n",
    "    ``` \n",
    "    a,b,c = 1,2,3       # Assign multiple values\n",
    "\n",
    "    x = y = z = 100     Assign the same values to multiple variables\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "\n",
    "- `variable_name`--> The label or identifier for object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `=`(Assignment Operator)--> Binds variable name to the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `value`--> The actual data(Python object) stored in memory.\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 10 \n",
    "```\n",
    "- __An integer object (`10`) is created__ in memory .\n",
    "\n",
    "- `x` is assigned as a __reference__ to this object/\n",
    "\n",
    "- If `x` is reassigned (`x = 20`), the old __reference (`10`) is removed__, and __a new object (`20`) is created.__\n",

    "### Reference Counting\n",
    "\n",
